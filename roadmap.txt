- read patterns from disk, file, url
- enter patterns by hand
- have a top page that says
  - start a new universe
  - list universes (clickable)
  - view universe
- save patterns
- select subpatterns; drag and drop
- drag and drop while continuing animation
- detect periodic patterns at fringes and delete them.  E.g. If there's a
  glider at the edge, and it's far enough away from everything else that they
  could never catch it (I think all of 2 cells might do it), delete it.
- reset to start pattern
- allow multiple users
  - this *may* work now
