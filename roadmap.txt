- read patterns from disk, file, url
- enter patterns by hand
- model/view/controller: multiple views: web, terminal, iPhone
  - option to have de-synchronized views: if one can display faster, let it
    run on ahead
  - You can already have multiple web browsers pointed at the server and get
    the running universe.
  - Problems:
    - Each universe image is rendered separately
    - there's no communication between the two views: if view 1 stops, view 2
      keeps going.
    - each "next gen" request from each viewer causes a generation, instead of
      both just getting the current generation.
  - Resolution
    - client tells server delay, start, stop
    - server tells other clients to start, stop, and what delay to use
    - server delays internally
    - server has a list of individual "users" (universes?) & views of each
      universe
    - short term:
      - use /life/1/index.html, life/2/index.html, etc for different universes
    - long term:
      - have a top page that says
     - start a new universe
     - list universes (clickable)
     - view universe
- save patterns
- select subpatterns; drag and drop
- drag and drop while continuing animation
- detect periodic patterns at fringes and delete them.  E.g. If there's a
  glider at the edge, and it's far enough away from everything else that they
  could never catch it (I think all of 2 cells might do it), delete it.
- reset to start pattern
- allow multiple users
