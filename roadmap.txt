- read patterns from disk, file, url
- enter patterns by hand
- have a top page that says
  - start a new universe
    - use pre-loaded patterns
      - names and thumbnails
    - load a pattern
      - from disk
      - from a url
    - enter a pattern by hand
  - list current universes (click to choose one)
- save patterns
- reset to start pattern
- select subpatterns; drag and drop
- drag and drop while continuing animation
- detect periodic patterns at fringes and delete them.  E.g. If there's a
  glider at the edge, and it's far enough away from everything else that they
  could never catch it (I think all of 2 cells might do it), delete it.
- allow multiple users
  - this *may* work now
